# Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

# For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

# You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.


def numDecode(msg):
    dict = {}
    # I know there's a sumple way to map each number to each letter
    dict = {{1, 26}, {a, z}}
    return 0


numDecode(111)
