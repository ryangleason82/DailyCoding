#### Mistakes I Have Made

- When iterating through list in python:
  - list index out of range
  - Index out of range unless you use range(len(lst))
- When adding to a list:

  - list assignment index out of range
  - lst.append(val)

- For Jun1st.py, attempted to use a linked list and "Runner Method"
  - It would end up needing two loops which is just as inefficient as the brute force method I developed
  - Only use when you know you need to iterate once and not go back to the beginning
  - I still need to understand the solution
